If all \nscripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and \ncoming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  \nYet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare \nheads.

He proclaimed himself as \nChrist.\n\nKoresh himself came from an SDA background.

That is, this evidence\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\nto us.\n\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be\nphysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for\nall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\n\n>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\n\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.\n-- \n==============================================================================\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n>but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its\n>infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian\n>group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which\n>basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.

If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?

It is \"obvious\"ly wrong to\nbe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry\nwhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us\nfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgive\nthem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus\nhas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of\nlove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause\nfoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.\n\nIt's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to\naddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out\nthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\nAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would\nframe a response something like this:\n\n\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment\nfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We\nwill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the\nopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with\nall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our\nsin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life\nfor him.\n Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not\nto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\nor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through\nthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"\n\nThe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\nof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is\nactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been\nexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your\nperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.\n\nYou are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people\nbecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and\nI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the\ncity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some\nbrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so\nthat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.\n\nThe third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\ncontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.\n\nThe important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's\ncommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or\nmisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to\nprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,\nis to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or\nhusband.\n\nI hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.\n\nLove,\n\nAaron Cardenas\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: hayesstw@risc1.unisa.ac.za (Steve Hayes)\nSubject: Re: The arrogance of Christians\nOrganization: University of South Africa\nLines: 36\n\nIn article <Apr.16.23.18.07.1993.1879@geneva.rutgers.edu> phs431d@vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au writes:\n>But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a\n>non-existent danger?

When science\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.

It's a very biblical doctrine as\nRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\nwithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\n\n>yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that\n>punishment at the last judgement. \n\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\nfor those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\nor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal\npunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it\n(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were\nforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I\nneed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is\nquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from\nthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,\nJerusalem in 70 AD, etc.\n\n> if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is\nnot a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we\nnot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more\n>innocent?\n\nWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\ndoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\nU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an\nisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in\nthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily\ninvolved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are the\npeacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.

Some people really have heard God, and others\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\n\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"\n\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \n\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\nbefore he gave them.  \n\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \nScripture.  \n\n>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new\n>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call\n>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with\n>knowledge?\n\nI don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let another\ntake\" concerning Judas office.\n\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \n\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.\n\nLink Hudson.\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: jkellett@netcom.com (Joe Kellett)\nSubject: Re: Hell\nOrganization: Netcom\nLines: 17\n\nIn article <Apr.10.05.33.44.1993.14422@athos.rutgers.edu> mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu (Michael Covington) writes:\n>\n>In a short poem (\"God in His mercy made / the fixed pains of Hell\"),\n>C.

We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines \nregarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of\nthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into\nthe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that\na split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games\nlike \"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does\nis effective...\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.\n\n>So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\n>Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\n>way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\n>traditional teaching of the Church is.\n\nWe sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.

Would it be honored?  If not, how\ndo you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\nAgain, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\nSince I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\none way or the other.\n\n>Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\n>command).

I know\n>that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet\n>hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,\n>do you still think that just believing is enough?'\n\nActually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \nlater and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\nthe Greek.\n\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\nburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\nwriters intended.\n\n>Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves\n>and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.\n\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\n\n>But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to\n>him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who\n>knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.\n\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\n\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.\n\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\nJesus calls being born again.\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: mdbs@ms.uky.edu (no name)\nSubject: tuff to be a Christian?\nOrganization: University Of Kentucky, Dept. of Math Sciences\nLines: 63\n\nbissda@saturn.wwc.edu (DAN LAWRENCE BISSELL) writes:\n\n>\tI don't think most people understand what a Christian is.

Buehler)\nSubject: Re: SSPX schism ?\nOrganization: none\nLines: 240\n\nLarry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\n\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\n   provided for in canon law.\n\nHere's some of the theology involved for the interested.\n\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \"schism\"; often the\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\n\n- true obedience\n- false obedience\n- disobedience\n- schism\n\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\n\n1) a command\n2) the response made to the command\n\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\n\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\n\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\n\ncommand         response            name\n-----------------------------------------------------\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\n\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\n\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\nconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\n\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!\n\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\n\nAnd there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\ncourse disagreed.\n\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\n\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\n\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\nleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\nbadly.\n\nSchism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?\n\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so\nit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with\nthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.\n\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\n\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\ncommand.\n\nHere's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\n\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\n\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\nday.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.\n\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\n\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\nHoly Father's motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It's the\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\nPapal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope\nhimself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.\n\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\n\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\nconstituted a schismatic act.\n\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\nof Tradtion.\n\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.\n\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\n\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\n\nThe Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\nThere's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\n\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's\nthe passage in question:\n\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\n\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\n\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\n\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\n\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\nbe simplified to the following:\n\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\n- I am the Pope.\n\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\nThis is weak, to say the least!\n\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\nArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\n\nI don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\n\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\n\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\ndiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\nthat you say defines schism.\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "Subject: Re: Ancient islamic rituals\nFrom: bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine)\nOrganization: Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton,  OR.\nLines: 33\n\nIn article <1993Apr3.081052.11292@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au> darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice) writes:\n>I propose\n>that these two trends -- greater level of general depression in society\n>(and other psychological problems) and greater sexual promiscuity -- are\n>linked, with the latter being a prime cause of the former.

As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\nit he says:\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\nEinstein has also said:\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\nhis original statement, and wrote:\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!

But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.

I know what you're alluding to in that the\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.

The early church struggled with the\nTrinitarian formulation.  The reformation dealt with authority.  Today,\neschatology has had much study.  The early creeds do not spell these things out\nin detail because, 1) they weren't the topic of concern, 2) there was\ninsufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn't have the exegetical tools that\nwe have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One\nage has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is\ngiven growth.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\nSodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says:\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\nexpect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said:\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\n\nI once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: rich0043@student.tc.umn.edu (Timothy Richardson)\nSubject: Re: Seeking Christian opinion, all sorts.\nOrganization: Pygmalion Productions\nLines: 22\n\nSubject: Re: Seeking Christian opinion, all sorts.\nFrom: Rob Steele, rsteele@adam.ll.mit.edu\nDate: 5 May 93 06:52:54 GMT\n\n>Do you mean that your fellow Christians tend to find you wacky?

It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I\nwill explain below.\n\n\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture,\nexcept the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are -\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,\nFour books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of\nParalpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five\nbooks of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of\nSolomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach],\nThe books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being\nJeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were\nformerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two\nbooks of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of\nthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the\nApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same\nto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the\nApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of\nJohn.\"\n\t-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)\n\n\tThis same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage\n(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which\ncouncil the same list was enumerated with the words \"Because we have\nrecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the\nChurch.\"  Which ought to quiet those who assert \"in the name of Holy\nScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was\nnever any doubt in the Church,\" as the Episcopal Church does in removing\nthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians\nhold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not\ncounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The\nLutherans hold out similarly.)\n\tEarlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also\nbe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it\ndivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.\n\n\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as\nconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the\nnumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also\nthat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,\ncorresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks.\"\n\t-St. Hillary of Poitiers, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" prologue, 15 (365 AD)\n\n\"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with\nLamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is\nMaccabees.\"\n\t-Origen, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" Psalm 1 (245 AD)\n\n\"Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to\nthe boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows].\"\n\t-St. Clement of Alexandria, \"The Instuctor of Children,\" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)\n\n\"....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of\nSolomon, and also Wisdom ...\"\n\t-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius' \"History of the\nChurch,\" and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14\n\n\"It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divine\nScriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must\nshun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;\nEcclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of\nMaccabees, two books.\"\n\t-St. Damasus I, Pope, \"The Decree of Damsus,\" section 2 (382 AD)\n\n\tI would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Church\nhas always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed\nby various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testament\ndeutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2\nPeter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neither\nshould it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out that\nthe Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding\nof the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a\ncanon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian\nuse of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As early\nas 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the\nCanon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestants\napparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decree\nof the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews') faithless canon, and\nthat he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up the\ncanon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some\n80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, and\nnot the Hebrew.

So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\nignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\n\nLater,\nMax (Bob) Muir\n\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\ncited passages are:\n\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\nthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\nabout homosexuality.\n\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\nNote that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\npassage.  It does not use the word \"homosexuality\", and it is referring\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\nSo it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \nhomosexuality.\n\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\n1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\nsuch as \"wanton\", and that another may be specifically \"male\nprostitute\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\nshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.\n\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that \"strange flesh\" refers to\nintercourse with angels.\n\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\nthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\n\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's\nclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down\nto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they\nbelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This\nappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a\nwhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.\nThis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference\nbetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both\nsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they\nkeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the\nother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things\nvery frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic\noutcome is not very likely...\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: qpliu@phoenix.Princeton.EDU (q.p.liu)\nSubject: Re: free moral agency\nOriginator: news@nimaster\nNntp-Posting-Host: phoenix.princeton.edu\nReply-To: qpliu@princeton.edu\nOrganization: Princeton University\nLines: 26\n\nIn article <kmr4.1575.734879106@po.CWRU.edu> kmr4@po.CWRU.edu (Keith M.

In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\n`properly formed'.

I am\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\nfrom `confident'.\n\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\n\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\nidea of his own fallibility.\n\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.

When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's\nunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\nconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\nand I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's\nsome chance I'm wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\nThat you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate.

And, the\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\n       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more.\"   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\nthe message of the church's gospel.\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases.\"\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name.\"\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them.\"\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world.\"\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\n       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\f\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt.\"\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\n\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool.\"\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever.\"\n\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses & Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter's\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n& Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\n       don't know what they do!\"\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\f\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!\"\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\n\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: \"Don't think that I have come to\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven't come to bring peace,\n       but rather a sword.\"\n\n\n\n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: pwhite@empros.com (Peter White)\nSubject: Some questions from a new Christian\nLines: 50\n\nReply-To: pwhite@empros.com\nIn article <Apr.15.00.58.29.1993.28900@athos.rutgers.edu>, 18669@bach.udel.edu (Steven R Hoskins) writes:\n \n|> I have another question I would like to ask.

I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want \nthem attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).

Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\n\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\narea.\n\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required by\northodox doctrine.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is\nalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)\n\nI've been working at this company for eight years in various\nengineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\non seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this\ncompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\n\nI'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\n\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\n\n\t- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\n\t- someone's sick idea of flirting\n\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\n\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\nme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\n\nI can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the\noffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\nwants to do to my body.\n\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\nleft in my desk drawer.\n\nI need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\nthat it's ridiculous.\n\nI feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\nlike I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple\nphone call saying \"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\"\n\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\nisn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\ndo me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\n\nAnd please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this.\nThat's my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you're not worth\nanyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\", \"you're right,\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\ncompany so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\n\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God.\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\nGod, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\nseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his\nloving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the\nhand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding\non to me.)\n\nAlthough this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,\nI really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this\nreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After\nall, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall\ntopics.\n\nThanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.

He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views &\ndidn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.

As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\n\n->\tNiether was he a lunatic.

That is the logical pitfall that those who\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \npossible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\nall other possible alternatives.\n\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\n\n->\tSome other things to note.

It wouldn't be any great shakes to make\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.

I'm not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people\nare tormented forever.\n\nPsalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu (Bill Conner)\nSubject: Re: some thoughts.\nNntp-Posting-Host: okcforum.osrhe.edu\nOrganization: Okcforum Unix Users Group\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]\nLines: 18\n\nKent Sandvik (sandvik@newton.apple.com) wrote:\n: In article <11838@vice.ICO.TEK.COM>, bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert\n: Beauchaine) wrote:\n: >   Someone spank me if I'm wrong, but didn't Lord, Liar, or Lunatic\n: >   originate with C.S.

The founder of this\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\n\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\n\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's\ninternal resources.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal religion.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================\n\n        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will\nofficially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If\nthe group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  \"YES/Create\"  votes\nthan  \"NO/don't  create\"  votes;  the group shall be created.

Some say that if the two have\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.\n\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\n\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\n\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\npoint of intercourse.\n\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\nand Joseph went to bed together.\n\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\ndescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\n\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be\ncorrected on that point!)\n\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\n\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?\n\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\n\n-- \n\n-----\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\n\n\tAnd hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\n\tCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: livesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey)\nSubject: Re: Moraltiy?

Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\ncourse not.\n\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\nonly an idiot would think so.\n\nDo you see my point?\n\n>It is very natural to think that\n>the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic\n>structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm\n>shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of \n>the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial \n>revolution.

For a\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\ncompletely absurd.

Bishop\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\n\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\nVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a\ndefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to\ndefining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic\ndoctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.\nHe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In\nthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he\nrecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the\nChurch.\n\nIf you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such\nsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you\nwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall\ninto heresy or schism.\n\nThe teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope\nmust be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith.\nA Pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the\nCatholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no\nlegal *or* moral force.\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: caralv@caralv.auto-trol.com (Carol Alvin)\nSubject: Re: The arrogance of Christians\nLines: 54\n\n> I've just read Carol's response and I just had to get into this.

Buehler)\nSubject: Re: SSPX schism ?\nOrganization: none\nLines: 182\n\nHere is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\n\nJoe Buehler\n\n...\n\nSchism and Disobedience\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\n\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\nheresy.\"\n\n...\n\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\n\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\nresponse.\n\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\nagainst the unity of the Church.\n\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\n\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\n\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\nparallel Church.\n\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\nimagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:\n\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\n\n....\n\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\n\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:\n\n    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June\n    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also\n    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist \"obstinancies.\" And from the\n    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to\n    present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense\n    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has \"an\n    erroneous concept of Tradition.\" If this were so, Cardinal\n    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the\n    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:\n    \"Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it\n    'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to\n    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern\n    and shares it.\"\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: parkin@Eng.Sun.COM (Michael Parkin)\nSubject: Re: DID HE REALLY RISE???\nReply-To: parkin@Eng.Sun.COM\nOrganization: Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View, CA\nLines: 57\n\nAnother issue of importance.

The\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\n\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq's military potential.

War is never an exact science, but\nwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\nof civilian casualties.

My only regret is\nthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.

One is not found guilty if there is\na reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have \nwith it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for\nothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just \nChristian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems\nwithin Christianity.

What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these \nmatters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them \nbut are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this\nthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus \nanyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing\nthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the\nhonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.\nEven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is\nuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud\nnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that\nleads to arrogance.

Jesus did not deal explicitly with\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\n\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\nother newsgroups.\n\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\nit applies to Gentiles.\n\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\n\nI'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's\nunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we\ndo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus\ndealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt\nwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15\nmore than Paul).

It\ngrew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus\nare two different people who happened to be united in the same body\ntemporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia\nand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes\nthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is\ncorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had\nonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the\northodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two\nenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect\nharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus\ncame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human\nwill.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to\noriginal sin.\nIt is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this\nconflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but\nnot two wills or two energies.

But I'd like to be\na bit wary about the Copts, Armenians, etc.  Recent discussions\nsuggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from\northodoxy as many had thought.  Nestorius was an extreme\nrepresentative of one of the two major schools of thought.  More\nmoderate representatives were regarded as orthodox, e.g. Theodore of\nMopsuestia.

In the last few\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \npresent to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.\n\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\n(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\nliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\npeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.\n\nSo we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\ngoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \nof God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?\n\nJohn Murray\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: lhep_ltd@uhura.cc.rochester.edu (Leonidas Hepis)\nSubject: Re: Prophecy on NYC\nOrganization: University of Rochester - Rochester, New York\nLines: 46\n\nmarka@travis.csd.harris.com (Mark Ashley) writes:\n\nIn soc.religion.christian you write:\n\n>Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\n     be to know God.\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\n\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\n         6:3.\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\n         unlimited power over all creation).\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\n         regarding salvation.\n\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  In creation\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\n          Heb. 1:3.\n     B.  In salvation\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\n         active in salvation.\n         1.  God, the Father\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\n             important works:\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\n             following ways:\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\n\n\n----------------------------------\nLiane Brown\n(Internet) brownli@ohsu.edu\nPortland Oregon\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: keith@cco.caltech.edu (Keith Allan Schneider)\nSubject: Re: Morality?

I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and \n`Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.

If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God's\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\nsome people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \"A Pilgrim's\nProgress,\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\n\n>Peace and Love\n>In God(ess)'s name\n>James Moss\n\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\nwrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.

No\n: reasonable alternative exists.\n\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\nappropriate group to ask this question.\n\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\n\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n\nand\n\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\n\nI would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\none's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\n\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\n\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.\nA being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\n\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\ndon't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\n\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\nappropriate for discussions like this.\n \n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n \n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\n: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\n\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\nCape, London 1992.\n\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \n\n: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\n\nExactly.

In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.

I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\nmind...\n\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\nintended for.\n\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\nkill by their leaders.\n\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \n\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\nparts of Man's history.@\n\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\n\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\n\n-ciao\n\n-chris blask\n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice)\nSubject: Re: Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\nOrganization: Monash University, Melb., Australia.\nLines: 131\n\nIn <2942956021.3.p00261@psilink.com> \"Robert Knowles\" <p00261@psilink.com> writes:\n\n>>DATE:   Sat, 3 Apr 1993 10:00:39 GMT\n>>FROM:   Fred Rice <darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>\n>>\n>>In <1p8ivt$cfj@fido.asd.sgi.com> livesey@solntze.wpd.sgi.com (Jon Livesey) writes:\n>>\n>>>Should we British go around blowing up skyscrapers next?\n>>\n>>I don't know if you are doing so, but it seems you are implying \n>>(1) that the person accused of blowing up the WTC in NY actually did it,\n>>and\n>>(2) that Islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the WTC.\n>>\n>>[WTC = World Trade Centre, which was the building that was blown up, I\n>>think.]\n>>\n>>Okay... to make some comments...\n>>\n>>(1) The person has only been accused -- innocent until proven guilty,\n>>remember?

As his guilt has not been established, it is\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\n\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \ndistinction.\n\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \noutwardly profess\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\n\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu'min\", which means \"true\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\nwill not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu'min\", or \"true believer\" in\nIslam.\n\n Fred Rice\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n\n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: oser@fermi.wustl.edu (Scott Oser)\nSubject: Re: DID HE REALLY RISE?\nOrganization: Washington University Astrophysics\nLines: 4\n\nFrank, I got your mailing on early historical references to Christianity.\nI'd like to respond, but I lost your address.

Summary: we ask \"Why does the\nuniverse exist\" ]\n\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n= \n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n= \n= and\n= \n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n= \n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\n=\n= I would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\n\n= The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\n= demanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\n= or in non-existence\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\n= don't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the \"counter-question\". \nThe first asks \"Why\", while the second is a request for definition.  It \ndoesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren't they mutually exclusive\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\nnearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I\nwould appreciate an explanation). \n\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\ndon't...don't\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\nas does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\nreason.\n\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\nbeginning.  \n\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nTime will tell. 8^)\n\n= \n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\nwell.\n\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\n\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\n\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\nCreator.\n\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\nthat 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \n\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n= \n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\n\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".

That is, we \nobserve in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced \nby a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be \nits own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.\n\nGod, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject \nto such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being, \nGod's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence \nof a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the \nsupernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused \nphenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the \nsupernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very \nnature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.\n\nThis is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted \nto clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the \nnatural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being \ninterchangeable.\n\n- Mark\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre)\nSubject: Re: Atheists and Hell\nOrganization: University of Nebraska at Omaha\nLines: 52\n\natterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu  writes:\n\n>   Hello,\n\n>   I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on\n> the newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.  \n> Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...\n\n> 1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.\n\nTrue to a point.

The message of \"praying in Jesus' name\" is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.

Chance would have it that \"my weekend\" with my \ndaughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.\n\nAlthough I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided\nthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith\nwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a\ndate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.\n\nDuring the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. \n\nWhen our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she \nbe baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.\n\nDuring a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease\nthat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for\ntwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \"effectively\".\n\nIn other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.\n\nDuring the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over\nmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday\nvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study\nbooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.\n\nLast fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.\nAt that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\nreligious community.\n\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\npew in front of us.\n\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\nif you try.

I have difficulty blaming her directly\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\n\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\nwith her again.\n\nI do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die.

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: mas@Cadence.COM (Masud Khan)\nSubject: Re: Slavery (was Re: Why is sex only allowed in marriage: ...)\nOrganization: Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\nLines: 39\n\nIn article <1993Apr12.124221.22592@bradford.ac.uk> L.Newnham@bradford.ac.uk (Leonard Newnham) writes:\n>\n>Oh, this all sounds so nice!

Tucker\t\tKG2S\t\t     drt@athena.mit.edu|\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\n\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: JBUDDENBERG@vax.cns.muskingum.edu (Jimmy Buddenberg)\nSubject: Revelations - BABYLON?\nOrganization: Muskingum College\nLines: 34\n\n\nHello all.

My comments are based\nprimarily on William Rusch's historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\nControversy\", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\n\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\n \n[SECOND CENTURY\n\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\nThus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\n\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\n\n\nTHIRD CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nDynamic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Theodotus\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\nconsubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\nsense of the word.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\n'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\na hypostatic union.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\nwithout beginning or end.\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\ndoctrine of salvation.\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\nChurch.  --clh]\n\n \nModalistic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Praxeas\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\n(Jesus Only)\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\nthe only unique and unitary God\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\nregeneration and sanctification.\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism.\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\n \n[I've moved the following description to be with the other\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\n\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\n\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\nthrough the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\n\n\nFOURTH CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\n \nSource: Arius\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known\ncults\nPerception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\nhe is not of the divine essence.\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\n \nOrthodox Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Athanasius\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\nPerception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\neternal.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\nthe divine essence and function.\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\nmust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council\nof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of\nthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]\n\nAdapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

It is\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\ninevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\nplan might be accomplished.\n    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\nfulfill the chorus of \"Let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \nDon't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \"Mene, mene,\ntekel, peres?\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\nquite clear.\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\nJesus Christ is as follows: \"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\nhand.\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"Let\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\"  There is not an infinite\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \"well, alright,\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I'm just a sweety-pie\nwho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and\nDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\nworld.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx\nin advance)\n\nI want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There\nis this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says:\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\n\n[I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\nof the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\ntext.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\nit has much practical effect.\n\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\nthat don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\nall the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition\nthat's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\ninconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there\nare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,\nI'm afraid.)\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: johnsd2@rpi.edu (Dan Johnson)\nSubject: Re: Atheists and Hell\nReply-To: johnsd2@rpi.edu\nOrganization: not Sun Microsystems\nLines: 38\n\nIn article 29279@athos.rutgers.edu, atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Cardinal Ximenez) writes:\n\n>  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the \n>newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.  \n>Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...\n\n>1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.\n\n>2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death\n>   is unfair.\n\n>  I don't see what the problem is!

It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.

I've known\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\n\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like \"I'm here in this\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\nSubject: John 3:16 paraphrased\nLines: 25\n\nAt the end of a recent (Mon 19 Apr 1993) post, Alastair Thomson\noffers the following \"paraphrase\" of John 3:16:\n\n   \"God loved the world so much, that he gave us His Son,\n   to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life.\"\n\nThe \"to die in our place\" bothers me, since it inserts into the\nverse a doctrine not found in the original.

You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the\n\"great judgement\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).\nI was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the\nchurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \"soul\"\n(which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?\n\n2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms \nthat my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My\nphysical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my\nnew body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal\nso it can be tortured for all eternity?\n\n3.

I\nthink the most common view is that final disposition does not occur\nuntil a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the\nmeantime, some believe that people \"sleep\" until the final\nresurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death\nto the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe\nthat souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.\nThere are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.\n\nThe new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a\ndifferent \"technology\" than the current one, one which is not mortal.\n(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus'\nresurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not\nsubject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)

You are probably thinking of Church of God in\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\n\n\t2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\na Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\nto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\nmajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in\nMark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally\ndo not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't\n\"saved\".\n\n\t3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that\nhas such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big\ngeneralizations here.

In fact I would have characterized them\nas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as\na sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be\ninclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,\nthey do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be\ncharismatic.\n\nKen Banner\nDept. of Religious Studies\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nkbanner@philae.sas.upenn.edu \n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: timmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu (Bake Timmons)\nSubject: Re: Amusing atheists and agnostics\nLines: 76\n\n\nChris Faehl writes:\n\n> >Many atheists do not mock the concept of a god, they are shocked that\n> >so many theists have fallen to such a low level that they actually\n> >believe in a god.

As you might expect, there is a range\nof answers.  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never\njustified.  (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused,\nor for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions\nthat I know.  No one should be forced to stay in a situation where\nthey are in danger.)  Others see it as a last resort in situations\nthat have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is\nto choose the lesser of evils.  In some sense the difficult legal\nquestion turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  That's because\nof Jesus' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par.  As with so many other\nthings, this turns on your approach to the Bible.  Conservative\nProtestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions.\nMore liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where\na literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (It is noted\nthat at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost\non a whim.  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is\nthat Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not\nto establish an absolute rule to which there could never be\nexceptions.)  Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take a\ntheoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through\nthe process of anullment.  In the last discussion most of our\nnon-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that\nin some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a\nfeeling that the church should often be doing a better job of\nhelping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that\ncome up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce\nshould not be necessary.  --clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik)\nSubject: Re: islamic authority over women\nOrganization: Cookamunga Tourist Bureau\nLines: 21\n\nIn article <1993Apr19.120352.1574@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au>,\ndarice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (Fred Rice) wrote:\n>> The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_\n> believer and who may be \"faking it\".

Post it only\nif you think it of general interest.\n\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\nfind it relevant.\n\nA listmember asks:\n\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\n\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\n\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\ntogether.\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.\n      She says: What are you talking about?\n      He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and\nyounger.\n      She says: But you can't. We are married!\n      He says: What are you talking about? We never got married.\n      She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the night\nwe first made love. You said: \"My love for you is as deep as the\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\n      He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When a\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\nthings like that. You mustn't take them literally.\n\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\na matter of public record.\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\nor just \"poetry.\"\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\n\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\nthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\nand \"till death do us part.\"\n\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\nthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\nother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\nout on? \" The original questioner said: \"Good grief, I never thought\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nsomeone who says, \"We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\nbother.\n\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\ncommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\nus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\n\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: stanly@grok11.columbiasc.ncr.com (stanly)\nSubject: Re: Elder Brother\nOrganization: NCR Corp., Columbia SC\nLines: 15\n\nIn article <Apr.8.00.57.41.1993.28246@athos.rutgers.edu> REXLEX@fnal.gov writes:\n>In article <Apr.7.01.56.56.1993.22824@athos.rutgers.edu> shrum@hpfcso.fc.hp.com\n>Matt. 22:9-14 'Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find\n>there, invite to the wedding feast.'...\n\n>hmmmmmm.

This\n>also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of\n>David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as\n>well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ's LEGAL FATHER.\n\nThe argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\nto Luke 3:23\n\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\n   the son of Eli,\n\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\n\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\n\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \n\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\n\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\n\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\ndetails are described in Steiner's \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\nMatthew\". \n\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\n\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\nJewishness.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when\nyou've heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\n\"therefore\".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God.\"\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\n\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\nB\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\n\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. \nIf the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent's particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent's argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou're white.\"\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\n\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred.\"\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me\nguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\n\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\nand\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer\"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists.\"\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere.\"\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache.\"\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons.\"\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice.\"\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\nor\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\nand\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight.\"\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana.\"\n\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of\nhistory?\"\n\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a\nform of Christianity?\"\n\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because \"that's the way it's always been.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\n\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n\"You're just being randomly abusive.\"\n\"So?  You've been abusive too.\"\n\n\u00ff\n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: David.Rice@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: islamic authority [sic] over women\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 62\n\n \nwho: kmr4@po.CWRU.edu (Keith M.

Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be\nforgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the\nafter-life)?

In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly\nanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings\nit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals\nof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that\nsince women can clearly be \"forgiven\" and \"rewarded\" they _must_ have\nsouls (from the above verse).\n\nLet's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than\ntry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this\npassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on\nignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations \nfully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\n\n Fred Rice\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: johnsd2@rpi.edu (Dan Johnson)\nSubject: Re: \"Accepting Jeesus in your heart...\"\nReply-To: johnsd2@rpi.edu\nOrganization: not Sun Microsystems\nLines: 95\n\nIn article 28388@athos.rutgers.edu, jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas) writes:\n>gsu0033@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu (Eric Molas) writes:\n>\n>> Firstly, I am an atheist.

While\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\n\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\nceremony itself.\n\n| Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\"\n| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely\n| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.\n\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\n\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\n\nWritings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\n\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\ndon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\n\n| Neither New Testament\n| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.\n\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\n\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\nwhich I have taken a few:\n\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\n\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\n(Matt. 19:11).\n\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\nnow\" (John 16:12).\n\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\n\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\n\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\n\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\n\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\nwere actually taught openly.\n\n| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire\n| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)\n| from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative\n| information on whether or not this claim is true?\n\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\nconnection has yet been established.\n\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: edm@twisto.compaq.com (Ed McCreary)\nSubject: Re: thoughts on christians\nIn-Reply-To: bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM's message of 16 Apr 93 05: 10:18 GMT\nOrganization: Compaq Computer Corp\nLines: 26\n\n>>>>> On 16 Apr 93 05:10:18 GMT, bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine) said:\n\nRB> In article <ofnWyG600WB699voA=@andrew.cmu.edu> pl1u+@andrew.cmu.edu (Patrick C Leger) writes:\n>EVER HEAR OF\n>BAPTISM AT BIRTH?

We Catholics\ndo believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in\nthe Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church.\nIt should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as\nSacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions.\nHowever, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to\nthe Church.

Overacker) writes:\n\n   You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\n   stood by the Pope.\n\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\ndisobeyed.\n\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\n\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\n   authority and discipline.  \n\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\nbishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.\n\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\nhour, probably.\n\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\n\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\n\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\n\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\n\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\n\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n\t the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n\t don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\n   If I adopt the view that \"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\n   there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\n   I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an\ninstant non-Catholic.\n\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\ndoing, they would be shocked!\n\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n\nThis isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\ndoctrine is.\n\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\n   I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nThat's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\nspread that it's pitiful.\n\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\nfact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\nrun.\n\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\n   Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\n   Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\n   one way or the other.\n\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\n\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\n   Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\n\nNot really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last\n300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels at\ncritical thought, remember?

I am familiar with the First Cause\nargument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there\nis a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices\nquestionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes\nthat the First Cause is God.\n\n>I next assert that God is all good.\n\nGot it. I deny that God is all good.

It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\n\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\n\n\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\n\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\n\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\n\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged....

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by \"fundamentalist\"?  I will\nfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes\nthat the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened\nto him is what he'll call being \"born again\"?  Anyway, was that recent?\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to all the questions above, it is quite\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!\nI think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\nis because they are now \"obvious\" to him.  What is \"obvious\" to him is\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\nfrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides of the fence\".  This\nI mean that before he turned \"fundamentalist\", you two are agreeable\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\ndiscovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\nhowever, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.\n\n[...]\n\n>the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him\n>that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve\n>what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great\n>friendship?  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he\n>won't try?  Thanks for any advice.\n\nSo far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's\ntrying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern\n\"for now\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -\nand that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to\ninsult where you stand too.\n\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\nI'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\nand just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\nto him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.\n\nI don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -\nthis is quite a challenge for you to face.

We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  \nman, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  \npeople harm (even medical corps of the army etc).\n\nChristians are by faith \"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\"  \n(Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \"God rules in the kingdoms of  \nmen\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  \nof those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.\n\nWe are to be \"strangers and pilgrims\" amongst the nations, so we are just  \npassing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  \n(this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We  \nare not supposed to \"strive\" or \"resist evil\" (even \"suffer yourselves to  \nbe defrauded\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  \npreserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  \nGod's kingdom.\n\nOur duty to the state.\n\n\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  \nthe things which be God's\" (Luke 20:25).\n\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power  \nbut of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth  \nthe power, resisteth the ordinance of God\" (Rom 13:1-2).\n\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether  \nit be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing  \nye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)\n\nThese scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  \ndivine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any  \nordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to  \nit. The reason for this is that we are God's \"bond servants\" and His  \nservice is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col  \n3:22-23 where bondservants were to \"work heartily as unto the Lord\" - so  \nalso we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \"Pressed down, shaken  \ntogether, and running over\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...\n\nIn the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is  \nnot fighting in the battle, but is \"testifying\" to the truth.\n\nWhen we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \"fellow  \ncitizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\", and are no longer  \ninterested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  \nunions etc as well. Paul tells us to \"lay aside every weight\" that we may  \nrun \"the race that is set before us\", and if we are wise, we will discard  \nany association which would retard our progress - \"Thou therefore endure  \nhardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  \nhimself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  \nchosen him to be a soldier\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).\n\nOne of these entanglements he warns about is \"be ye not unequally yoked  \ntogether with unbelievers\". One of the obvious applications of this is  \nmarriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  \npartnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  \nwith any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  \nthe army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  \nthem being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  \nunclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  \n- I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  \nservitude, and Jesus says \"take my yoke upon you\", so we are then yoked  \nwith Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  \nthat we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \"become not ye the  \nbondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).\n\nAn example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  \n\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\". The situation here is a good  \nexample of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  \nJehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:\n1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \"sold himself to work  \nwickedness before the Lord\" (1 Kings 21:25).\n2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  \n\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  \nyoking.\n3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  \non hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  \nfound that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  \nassociation he had made.\n\nGod says to us \"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  \nthe unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  \ndaughters\" (2 Cor 6:17).\n\nThis is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into  \nit, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  \nyet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:\n\nThe Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  \nfactor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).\n\nTotal dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).\n\nDisobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  \nfollowers (1 Pet 2:7-8).\n\nWe are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  \nrelationship (Rom 6:12,16).\n\nNo man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).\n\nAll that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  \nJohn 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  \nnature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  \nour master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  \nwas not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  \nmaster.\n\nStrangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  \nanyone but God.\n\nThe servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  \nthis does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  \nour lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor  \n10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).\n\nI'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  \nfurther.\n\n--\nGideon King                         | Phone +64-3-479 8347\nUniversity of Otago                 | Fax   +64-3-479 8529\nDepartment of Computer Science      | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nz\nP.O.

Did I misunderstand?\n\nReading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in\nthe world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\n\nLet's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\nto the Septuagint.\n\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\nhave little theological import.\n\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\nseptuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\nmaterial, but so far this hasn't happened.\n\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\nOT, unlike for the NT.\n-- \nC.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\n\n There is no need\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\n: determnined.\n\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\n: establish your values.\n\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\n\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \n\nPetri\n\n--\n ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.\n!___.'* '.'*' ' .

This is an improved\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\n\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\nand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\n\nI confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \nculture or is a later forgery.\n\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\n\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\nphysical objects.\n\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\n\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\ndetermine who the actual author was.\n\nAs I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \nSpecifically we might ask:\n\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\n\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\n\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\n\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\nreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.\n\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \nwhich don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\nknow everything about the culture.\n\nThe end result of any such testing is occasionally certain\n(particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies).\nHowever often it may just be a probability or an indication that\nthe document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (or\nsometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often \nunsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are\nsolved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.

Doctrinal\n>differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as\n>an answer.\n\n\nAs far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and\nChristians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself\nin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\nJesus.\n\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\nDavid Koresh was not.\n\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\nwould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\n\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\npeople to do bad things. \n\nI think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is\npresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,\nthen that man is performing a tremendous disservice.\n\nI know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to\nsay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\nworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.\nIt is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose\nanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the\nbegotten son of God, and nobody else is.

Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\nFestival.\"\n\nHowever, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n\n\n[No, I'm not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\nof celebrating Easter.

It happened\nin La Salle, France.\n\nThe moral lesson of the story is:\n\nThe Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has \nbeen used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives\nworthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and\nfor the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we \ndisobey God or sin against Him.

Also, she has been preparing the new \nEden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be\nthe sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His\nnext coming.\n    \nI relate the story again:\n    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions  \n    in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these      \n    two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot     \n    the exact place).

It is the fundamental premis \"A is not not-A\". If a thing\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \ntopics.)\n \n>Some take it to the extreme and say that\n>their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings\n>then you won't be \"saved\". \n\nNote that these are two separate ideas.

Saying that the glass \nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\n \nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\nto understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\nto say so.

Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\nthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\nparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\non the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\nover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\nfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\nmethods?\n \n > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate\n > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that\n > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?\n \n      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\ngoddess)?

Are there different \"rules\" that\napply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \"male and female\" can Adam\nand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are\ndifferences in form and function.

Some\nChristians prefer to refer to \"first day\", \"second day\", etc.  However\nthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.

Postings trying to convince\nthem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run\nthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.\nThey are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds\nbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.

In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \nhardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \npast and present. \n\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \nto God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \ntechnology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's  \nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \nMig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \npilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These  \neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\n\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.\n\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\n\n1. The Second World War\n\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\n\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \n\t\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n2. Korean war\n\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\n\t  communism vs. capitalism.\n\t- Probably not justifiable.\n\n3. Vietnam\n\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\n\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\n\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\n\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\n\t- Other factors such as genocide.\n\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\n\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\n\t- Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'\n\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\n\t- Probably justifiable\n\n7.

Andrew Byler)\nSubject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception\nOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 48\n\nBiblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:\n\n1) \"I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and\nbetween your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush\nyour head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.\"\n    -Genesis 3.15\n\n2) \"He who commits sin is of the devil ...\"\n    -1 John 3.8\n\n3) \"Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...\"\n    -Luke 1.28\n\n   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n   First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the\nfirst promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of\nSatan. \"[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in\nthe truth because there is no truth in him.\" John 8.44.  Now the\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\nsinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as\nwould God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"\n\nAndy Byler\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: kmr4@po.CWRU.edu (Keith M.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres\nand horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault\nof people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify\nit to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their\nambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in\nthe New Testament.

I doubt that we\nwould have the same freedoms in the countries in which we\nlive, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.\nPerhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion\n(I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which\nwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such\nsubjects.\n\nPoint the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for\npower, greed and hatred.

Some take it to the extreme and say that\ntheir religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings\nthen you won't be \"saved\". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim\nto know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your\ninterpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty\nin that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be\ncorrect. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.\nNo two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that\nthere is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it\nwhat you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is\njust there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,\nmeditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may\nperceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the\nother is right. As an example, take the question, \"Is the glass half\nempty or half full\"?

It could be that they're wrong.  But I\nhardly see that it's arrogance.  Let's look at this a bit closer.\nSuppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught\nus things, but didn't say anything about exclusivity.

Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \n\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"\n\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that\nthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  \n\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \n\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont's.\" \nWhether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \n\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don't believe in hell.  I\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\nmount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't\nwant to see them go there.\n\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \n\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. \nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\ndarkness.\"  \n\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a\nparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \n\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \n\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no\nfellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace\nin hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in\nhell.  \n\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \n\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\nministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\nillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking\nto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can't\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask\nme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\njudgment.  \n\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there's a probationary period\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\nthere is in heaven.  \n\nI don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\nhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\ncreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\n\n1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\npersuade men.\"\n\n2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like\nDirty Harry said, \"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do\nyou?\"  \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"  Don't be one of the \"whosoever\nwont's.\"  \n\n\"Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.\"\n\"There's no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another.\"\n--Rex\n \n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: jono@mac-ak-24.rtsg.mot.com (Jon Ogden)\nSubject: Re: Losing your temper is not a Christian trait\nOrganization: Motorola LPA Development\nLines: 26\n\nIn article <Apr.23.02.55.47.1993.3138@geneva.rutgers.edu>, jcj@tellabs.com\n(jcj) wrote:\n\n> I'd like to remind people of the withering of the fig tree and Jesus\n> driving the money changers et. al. out of the temple.

The fate of the other 60 or\n70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were\ninside.  The compound did burn to the ground.\n\nKoresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off\nand only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come\nout peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his\nmessage be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out.\nHe claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that\nGod told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in\nRevelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the\nfirst one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then.\nThe federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they \nwould be subjected to tear gas.\n\nI think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere\nman, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I\nthink it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in\nthings that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures\nsay and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you,\neven if those others are learned and mean well.\n\nPaul Conditt\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: llcoolj@athena.mit.edu (Alfred Eaton)\nSubject: Re: Mormon temples\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nLines: 16\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple\nceremony within the last fifty years....\nAlso, why do you think they were made (revelation, \nassimilation to mainstream Christianity, etc.)?\nI know that the God Makers was published quite a while\nago.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\nenvironment.\n \nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\nObjectives:\n \n                           MISSION\n \n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\n   which we must all live.\n \n                         OBJECTIVES\n \n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\n   objectives shall be:\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\n            focus the education and participatory\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\n            of environmental concern;\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\n            their branches a full complement of program\n            materials for their use, including suitable\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\n            desirable;\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\n            of program ideas, materials and information\n            among said organizations;  and\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\n \nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\nyouth membership.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\n \nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\nportions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\nplace.\n \nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\nForums.\n \nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\n============================================================================\n \nSubsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

God may choose one individual over\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\n\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\n\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\nrefute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\nChrist's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\n\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\nthe Baptist,\n\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\n\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing's \"The\nEducation of the Human Race\".\n\nTo return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\nChrist, in my view.\n\nRegards, \nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: will@futon.webo.dg.com (Will Taber)\nSubject: Re: Being right about messiahs\nLines: 41\n\nIn article 2262@geneva.rutgers.edu, Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca (Desiree Bradley) writes:\n> I must have missed the postings about Waco, David Koresh, and the Second\n> Coming.

I do know\nthat\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\nby the death penalty.\n\nMy understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\n\n\n> Stuff deleted\n> Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that\n> Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.

However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\n\nP.S.

We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed\nout, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.\nBut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe\nthe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \"the sinful\nmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,\n*nor can it do so*\"  (Romans 8:7).\n\nLuther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation\n(\"Sola Scriptura\"), but accepted the necessity of the use\nof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.\nYet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \"But mad reason\nrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like\nthe works which we do, regards it as worthless.\" (Large\nCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more\ncomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many \npeople would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him \ndescribed as a `take no prisoners' theologian.\n\nWe might conclude, given these observations, that Luther\nwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have\ncome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to\nrecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt\ncompelled to defend himself and the apostles against\na charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians\nought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) \nas mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who\nexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul\nsaid was true (Acts 17:11).\n\nThe basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many\nothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy\nSpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that\nguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the\ntruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the\nmessage that \"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\" but\nrather \"I know that my redeemer lives!\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian\ndoes not side with Pilate in saying \"What is truth?\" but rather\nfollows Christ, who said, \"In fact, for this reason I was born, and\nfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on\nthe side of truth listens to me\" (John 18:37).\n\nWe can know the truth because God has promised us that we can\nknow the truth.  Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teachings,\nyou are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,\nand the truth will set you free\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs\nurge us \"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\" (Pr 23:23).\nThe Psalmist prayed \"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\"\n(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth\nwas in fact `in his mouth'.  \n\nYet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth\nis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the\ntruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the \nSpirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready\nto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther\ndid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly\ntrust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his\npromise of forgiveness.\n\nREXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be \nREXLEX> absolute about a thing.\n\nDarren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,\nDarren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nI agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings\nof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such\nreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw\nthe line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'\nthan you would.\n\nDarren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations\nDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,\nDarren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nDarren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and\nDarren> absolutely true.

Did he mean\nDarren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he\nDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-\nDarren> substantiation?  He didn't say. \n\nDarren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement\nabout the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say\nthat if Jesus said, \"This is my body,\" then that is what we\nshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because\nthey are not taught in Scripture.\n\nRecall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also\nhave Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to\nus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \"For\nwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the\nLord's death until he comes.\"  By these words we should believe that\nthe bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as\nthe Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*\nthat tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that\nPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because\nthat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is\nfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary\nreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can\nprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.\n\n[side remark]\nI've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is\ncon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told\nme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this\nis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels\nto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's\nSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching\n\"real presence\" because that was the traditional teaching of \nthe church.\n[end side remark]\n\nDarren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning\nDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we\nDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe\nDarren> that implicit claim.

That which is authoratative is authoratative,\nand to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is \nopen to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\nhere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticated\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\nan authority. \n\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an \nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \n\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \nverify for himself.\n\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\n\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \n\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny\nGod's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\nnature, prove anything.\n\n\n\n-- \n==============================================================================\nMark Baker                  | \"The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts.\" -- C.

Now, this\nis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to \nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, \"because it involves\ntoo much study and effort.\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\n\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\nTruth.\n\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\n\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\n\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\n\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\n\n\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\n\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\n\n B: How do you know?\n\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\n\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\n\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\n\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\n\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\n\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is\n    true.

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\n\nBut first let me say the following.\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\nI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it's\n'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\nGod\".\n \nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\nWebster says:\n\nfaith \n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\nb  (1): fidelity to one's promises\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   (2): complete trust\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nof religious beliefs\nsyn see BELIEF\n\n\n\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be \nglad to.) \n\n\n\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \ndisagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \nthinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \nways and I correct the situation.

Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, \nalmost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable?\nSimilarly for right of life.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That\nSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no\nreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n> \n> Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body.

It is a\nbit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you\nanyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might\nbenefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.\n \n=======================================================================\n \n                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?\n \n \nQ. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,\n   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \"God Loves You.\"  Isn't\n   that true?\n \nA. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read\n   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:\n \n      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten\n      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but\n      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16\n \n   However, God's love is qualified.  The Bible says:\n \n      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he\n      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9\n \n      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of\n      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6\n \n \nQ. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good\n   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How\n   can these verses apply to me?\n \nA. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is\n   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The\n   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.\n   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before\n   God.\n \n      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There\n      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after\n      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11\n \n      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately\n      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9\n \n \nQ. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?\n \nA. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will\n   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.\n \n      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\n      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,\n      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap\n      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They\n      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\n      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of\n      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24\n \n \nQ. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not\n   that bad.\n \nA. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-\n   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\n \n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\n \n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\n \n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\n \n \nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\n \nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands\n   payment for sin.\n \n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\n \n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\n \n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\n \n \nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\n \nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\n \n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\n \n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\n \n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n \n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\n   Hell anymore?\n \nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\n \n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\n \n \nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\n   Hell?\n \nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\n \n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\n \n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\n   followers also go to Hell?\n \nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\n   save us.\n \n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\n \n   Jesus said:\n \n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\n \n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n                                                          1 John 1:9\n \n \nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\n \nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\n \n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\n \n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\n \n \nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\n \nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\n \n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\n \n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\n   the only Word of God.\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\n \n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\n \n \nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\n \nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\n \n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\n \n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\n   Hell.\n \n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\n \n \nQ. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\n \nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\n   ure.  Salvation is\n \n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\n \n \nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\n \nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\n   more.\n \n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\n \n \nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\n \nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\n   more.\n \n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\n \n \nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\n   come?\n \nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\n   save.\n \n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\n \n \nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\n \nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\n \n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\n \n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\n \n \nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\n \nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\n \n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\n \n \nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\n \nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\n \n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\n \n \nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\n \nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\n \n \nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\n   ment?\n \nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\n   become very short.\n \n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\n \n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\n      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8\n \n \n \n \n            A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?\n \n \n \nA  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical\ninformation that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor\nchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing\nand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph\nwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the\ntext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they\nappear here as indented paragraphs.\n \n \nI have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual-\nly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what\nthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that\nthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

However, discerning\nexactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so\neasy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should\nbehave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances\nat the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and\ncover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward\nothers.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived\nfrom absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to\nstrive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world\npeace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)\n \n>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \n>to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\n>Can you reconcile this?\n\nSure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those\ntruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does\npreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal\nclear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to\neveryone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is\nlargely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers\nare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is \nwhere scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.  \n \n>It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based \n>on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  \n\nGod revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\nrequires work on our part.\n\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\noneself about believing in the first place.  \n\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\ndoing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\nJesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.  \n\nJoe Fisher\n \n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: Petch@gvg47.gvg.tek.com (Chuck Petch)\nSubject: Daily Verse\nOrganization: Grass Valley Group, Grass Valley, CA\nLines: 4\n\nHe who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will\nbe my son. \n\nRevelation 21:7\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: karner@austin.ibm.com (F.

They believe they're going to _die_. Understand\nthat you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows\nthat all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want\nto say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,\nbut this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die\na final death))\n\n   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_\nsort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and\nnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that\nthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. \n(assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll\nnever know I'm dead.

The person in Hell would not be suffering. \nGranted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any\nconscious experience whatsoever). \n\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \n\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\nIt's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\nsuper-survival. \n\n \n>and it's a lot worse than Heaven.

If God is a King, and \nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\nI might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to\nconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_\nby Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. \n\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\" asked an\nEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something\nto the effect of, \"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?\nScram.\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an\naccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no \nimmortality). \n\n\n>Alan Terlep\t\t\t\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\n>Oakland University, Rochester, MI\t\t\t\n>atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\t\t\t\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\n>Rushing in where angels fear to tread.\t\t\n\n\n   Pax,\n\n    Dana\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de (Benedikt Rosenau)\nSubject: Re: The Inimitable Rushdie\nOrganization: Technical University Braunschweig, Germany\nLines: 11\n\nIn article <1993Apr16.211458.1@eagle.wesleyan.edu>\nkmagnacca@eagle.wesleyan.edu writes:\n \n(deletion)\n>Nope, Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws.

Protestants emphasize conversion,\nexperience of the Holy Spirit, and use of the Bible.  This is intended\nto make sure that Christians have religious experience of their own,\nand that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and\nother Christians.  I can't speak for Catholics and Orthodox, but I\nbelieve they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat\nwhat they are told.  I admit that this isn't always successful -- we\ncertainly see young people join our church because at that age parents\nexpect it.

Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and\n   glory.

To come up\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by\npersonality type summary file.\n\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.\n\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\npreferences have their place in the Body).\n\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\nexcerpted from my summary:\n\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\n\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\n                          world of people, activities or things.\n\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\n\n\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\nto fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects\nof how churches have not properly understood personality variances among\ntheir members to the detriment of all.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

I am not saying that I totally agree with his  \ninterpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  \ninterprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  \nold U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   \nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible  \nalso talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  \nparaphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,  \nthe whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  \nstate of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the \"do  \nit if it feels good\" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  \nMr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  \nBabylon \"Babylon the Great\" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  \nearth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  \ndon't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  \nmost powerful nation on earth.\n\nAgain, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  \nof consideration.\n\nJeffrey Little\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: hayesstw@risc1.unisa.ac.za (Steve Hayes)\nSubject: Re: The arrogance of Christians\nOrganization: University of South Africa\nLines: 51\n\nIn article <Apr.11.01.02.46.1993.17799@athos.rutgers.edu> mhsu@lonestar.utsa.edu (Melinda .

Smith, D.D.\n                              (1894-1977)\n\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\n\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\n\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\n\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\n\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\n\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\n\n          How did this tomb become empty?\n\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\n     chimney at Christmas time.\n\n          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\n\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\n\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\n\n          The facts are these:\n\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\n\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\n     the wrong tomb?\n\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\n\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\n\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\n               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\n\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\n\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\n\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\n\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\n\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\n     the body of Jesus.\n\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\n     then proved.\n\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\n     of these men did.\n\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\n\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\n     what had happened to Him.\n\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\n\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\n\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\n     8).\n\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\n     appearances.\n\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\n\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\n\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\n\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\n\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\n\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\n     else had it.\n\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\n     us.\n\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\n\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\n     that His words are all true?\n\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\n\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\n\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\n\n          Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been\n     many*--have given their testimony.

Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\n   \"send atheism/index\".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n\n\nmathew\n\u00ff\n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: wjhovi01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu\nSubject: Re: tuff to be a Christian?\nOrganization: University of Louisville\nLines: 24\n\nSomeone writing anonymously asks:\n\n> Would you have become a Christian if you had not\n> been indoctrinated by your parents?

Societal morality is necessarily\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\nbut is stronger.

If society is who should\nmake the rules, that's yet another.

The hard trick is to recognise when\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.\n\n# and only interfering when it's truly\n#>necessary.\n#\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\n\nIMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of\nliar's paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if\nwe don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.\n#\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\n#\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.

Random Misconfigured Site\nLines: 60\n\n\n\tThe problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.\n\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\npriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\nIt doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only\nslightly better.\n\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\ndoesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\n\nIn NYC I can recommend:\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \n\tSt. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\n\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\n\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\n\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen\n\nPaul Halsall\nHalsall@murray.fordham.edu\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: jcj@tellabs.com (jcj)\nSubject: Re: proof of resurection\nOrganization: Huh?

Random Misconfigured Site\nLines: 76\n\n\n\tI am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the\nrational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity\n[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\nBible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\nof Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\n\tBut recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\nviews about other human beings. \n\tnow the question is this: were the first Christians just as\nweird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine \"Fall of the\nChurch\" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\nwha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church.\nIt's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\nnot being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing,\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\n\tI would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\nthis entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants\nwith their \"soul alone with Jesus\" approach, but for we who see the\n\"ecclesia\" as a \"koinoia\" over time and space, the weird early\nChristians are a problem.\n\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no\nmeans the whole story.\n\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\nProtestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\n\"wierd\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at\nrecently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\nProtestant thought.)\n\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to\nthink that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help\nsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and\nsane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of\n\"revisionism\" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that\nthey're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.

When I look at\nJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the\npresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it\nwas brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of\nJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no\navail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not\nonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of\nJesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical\nportion was only the tip of the iceburg.\n\nBTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly\nking.  From John:\n\nJOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they\n            began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the\n            world.\"\nJOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by\n            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.\n\nThis does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an\nearthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\nwho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's\ndismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew\nwhat His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the\ndarkness of His Passion.\n\n-- \nJohn G.

We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you\nall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have\nthat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the\ntest.  Words and talk mean nothing.\n\nI could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but\nthis should be sufficient.\n\nHope it helped.\n\nJon\n\n----------------\nsig file broken....\n\nplease try later...\n----------------\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From:  (Rashid)\nSubject: Re: Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\nNntp-Posting-Host: 47.252.4.179\nOrganization: NH\nLines: 34\n\n> What about the Twelve Imams, who he considered incapable of error\n> or sin?

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\n('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\na threshold.\n  vonWrights's comment that Witt's \"sentences have a content that often lies\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\nWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\n\n  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\nand it is verifiable.

Perhaps they were \"strong in\nthe faith?\"\n\n---------------------------\n\n[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\nface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\ndidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\nceremonial aspects of it).\n\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\n\nHowever there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\nhave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and\nhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\nPaul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: healta@saturn.wwc.edu (Tammy R Healy)\nSubject: Re: Free Moral Agency and Kent S.\nLines: 37\nOrganization: Walla Walla College\nLines: 37\n\nIn article <sandvik-140493185034@sandvik-kent.apple.com> sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik) writes:\n>From: sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik)\n>Subject: Re: Free Moral Agency and Kent S.\n>Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 01:51:57 GMT\n>In article <healta.135.734811375@saturn.wwc.edu>, healta@saturn.wwc.edu\n>(TAMMY R HEALY) wrote:\n>> Ezekiel 28:17 says, Your hart was filled with pride because of all your \n>> beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor.

God then cannot ask for anything but  \npunishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  \n3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  \nthrough him it might be saved.\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  \nwith painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  \nagainst me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  \nthey are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  \ndis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the  \nfater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.\n  for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand  \nolone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.  \ni can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  \nHell? that step is much more rewarding.\n\nstan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu\nmy opinions are my own, you may borrow them\n\np.s. stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as  \nwell, he listens too.\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: mussack@austin.ibm.com (Christopher Mussack)\nSubject: Re: Sin\nOrganization: IBM Austin\nLines: 29\n\nIn article <Apr.8.00.59.20.1993.28493@athos.rutgers.edu>, jadaley@cwis.unomaha.edu (Jill Anne Daley) writes:\n> What exactly is a definition of sin and what are some examples.

Back\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All \nthings considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were\nessential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick\nend to avoid even greater allied losses.\n\nI, for one, don't regret it.\n\n> \n>>                                 War is never an exact science, but\n>> with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\n>> of civilian casualties.

Or do you mean that this applies to the allies\nas well??\n\n> \n> Why all the fuss about Kuwait and not East Timor, Bosnia, or even Tibet?  If\n> Iraq is so bad, why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before\n> we started bombing?\n\nI make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the\nWest before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\nstrong response from the West was required.\n\n> \n>> Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\n>> You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\n>> feel sure that was not your intent.\n> \n> What's your intent?

Or to allow them to continue with mass\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\n> \n>> So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?

And what makes you think the situation is\n> even remotely analogous to World War Two?\n\nI mentioned it.\n\nIf we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\n\n> \n>>                                                           I guess we\n>> shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\n>> German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.\n> \n> Yes, do.

But then\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that \nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\n\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\n\n> \n> mathew\n> [ \"Thou shalt not kill... unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing,\n>    in which case thou shalt kill, and also kill anyone who gets in the way,\n>    as unfortunately it cannot be helped.\"\n>                                    -- Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians ]\n\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n\"A Maze of Death\"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n\"VALIS\"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.

Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n\"The Bible\"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is\nabout.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\nGod\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

I was\nraised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an\nagnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the\nChristian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am\nhappy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and\nquite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying\nto rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful\nto also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other\nrelevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would\nlike to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological\nworks intended for a lay person?\n\nI have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated\nwith any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria\nshould one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference\nbetween the various Protestant denominations.\n\nThanks for reading my post. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Hoskins\n\n[Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an\nintroduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible\ncourses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary\nstyles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further\nreading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT\nintroduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  They\noften have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the best\nrecommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (I\nthink there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is a\nfairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the\nSociety for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy,\nyou will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read a\nlot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by Donald\nGuthrie looked rather good.

And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\n\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature\ndoes water boil at?\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\nif they knew what scale, and was told \"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\nThat's what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\n \n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\n\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\n \n>Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \n>to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\n>Can you reconcile this?\n\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\nI've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.

And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\n>\n>> >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical \n>> >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding \n>> >Biblical interpretation.\n>> \n>> So?

I can only rely upon MY experience.\nI also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\nTherefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  \nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\nGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\nWho cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \n\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\nwonderful and sensible.

That His existence can be proven by reason\nis indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \"Traditional Proofs for the \nExistence of God,\" and Summa Theologica).\n\nNow, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,\nI assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen\ncondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?\n\nBecause God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,\nthe Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the\nMeasure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order\nto the universe (logos).\n\nI next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is\ncontrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,\nsince God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior\nas early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because\na human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source\nof all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.\nThus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.\n\nNow this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim\nis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.\n\nYou next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United\nStates Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent\ninstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will\nreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,\nand thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For\nexample, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could\nhave denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must\nbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. \n\nTherefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.\n\nQED\n \n-- \nboundary\n\nno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he\nvenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) \n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\nSubject: Re: university violating separation of church/state?\nOrganization: Mantis Consultants, Cambridge.

Anyway...)\n\n\tThe basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of\nMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles \nand all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of\nthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\n\n\tHope this helps--I would welcome anyone who has more information to\n\tadd to what I've said.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker\n\t\t\t\t\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t\t\t\t  (Univ. of Illinois)\n\t\t\t\t\t  ]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: ide!twelker@uunet.uu.net (Steve Twelker)\nSubject: Esotericism\nOrganization: Interactive Development Environmenmts, SF\nLines: 11\n\nI'm compiling a bibliography on religious perspectives on esotericism,\nhermeticism, gnosticism, mysticism, occultism, alchemy and magic, and\nam interested in sources that others have found particularly interesting\nand insightful.

Yes, no contradiction\nbut also not much fact.\n\nThe Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being\nconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that\ntime, does not seem much of an achievement.\n\nThe book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had\ndivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot\nof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them\ncan be found in the Koran!

If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a\nbelief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No,\nthe spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be\nwilling to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so \nmonologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't\nseem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree)\nthere are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been\ndoing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that\neven the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national\nboundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be\nwilling to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc)\nBut my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution\nwe have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from\nthe dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman\nor greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e.\nemperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing\nto do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human \ntorches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a \nrisen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and\ncannablism.

The article\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\nspecifications given in the Bible. \n\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\nunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that\nthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding\nimpossible without sparking a holy war. \n\nNow it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming\nsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.\nAlthough the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think\nit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it\nhappen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is\ndrawing near.

No.  I have\nnever heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the\nLord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are\nmature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow\nbelievers for judgement.

I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     \"being.\"  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?

I got it from\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\neditor.\n\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\n\n    The Patron of Youth\n\n\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\n    the manner expected.\n\n    Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\n    more than his father.\n\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\n\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\n\n    He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to\tshow  his  reciprocal\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\n\n\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\tIgna-\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\n\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\n\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\n\n    The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\t\"Then\n    leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\"\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\tpray:\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\n    this  time\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\n    a Jesuit.\n\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\n    the dying for a holy death.\n\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\tcarrying  and\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\tto  the  Lord\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\n\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\n\n    - Brendan Arthur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\n\nGod Bless\n\nFrom Simon\nLines:  106\n-- \n/----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\\\n|  Simon P.

I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\nSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\nto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \nHis answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\n\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\nbase.  \n\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\nit of all value!\n\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\nlesson of life: \n\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \n\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\nfreedom.\n\nLet's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\n\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don't read all\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\nthe difference.\n\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\npractice.   \n\n--Rex\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: weaver@chdasic.sps.mot.com (Dave Weaver)\nSubject: Help\nLines: 44\n\nIn a prior article, lmvec@westminster.ac.uk (William Hargreaves) writes:\n>\n> Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)\n> as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James\n> in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'\n\nIf you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will \ngenerally find yourself in one of two camps: \n\n   (1) Faith + Works --> Salvation\nor (2) Faith --> Salvation + Works\n\nEither (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will \ninevitably result in good works. \n\nI am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on\nEphesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.

How much closer to the source can you get?\nThe Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \"inspired by God\", \nliterally means \"God-breathed\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words \ninto the scriptures.

The scenario you outline is reasonably \nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\nhow could it exist before humans?\n\n>                             God created the original genetic code\n>perfect and without flaw.

I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\ncollective sense.

Only a very small percentage of microlife is\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\n\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\n>humanity forsook God's protection.\n\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\nof did It just choose not to?\n\n[deletions]\n>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.\n\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\nthe explanation you give.

At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\n...\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\n...\n\nNow let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\n\nBaptism -\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\n\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\n power to think and to choose freely.\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\n title to enter heaven.\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\nfreely.\n\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\nbodies on the last day...\n\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):\n\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\n\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\n\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\n                definitely want to be with those He\n                has made _blessed_)\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\n\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\nand blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body\nof Christ and so,\n\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart. \n\n-Marida\n(P.S.  I do hope that others will continue more\n       light and facts on this matter.  Thanks.)\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: kmr4@po.CWRU.edu (Keith M.

Do you mean by \"omnipotent\"\nthat God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates\na self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively\nuseless.\n\nTo be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \"being all-powerful\" and\nnot \"being able to do anything/everything\".\n\nLet me illustrate by analogy.\nSuppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\nnation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\nUS see fit.  The US would be militarily \"omnipotent\".\n\nBut suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not\ninterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current\ncivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.\n\nTechnically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to \nunilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \nof non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to\nstrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would\never be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it\ncould actually do, although it had the power to do \"whatever it wanted\".\nThe US would simply \"never want to interfere\" for such an idea would\nbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate\nnon-interference policy.\n\nGod is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but\nHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what\nHe, Himself is.\n\nI hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning\nomnipotence.\n\nRegards,\n\nJim B.\n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: keith@cco.caltech.edu (Keith Allan Schneider)\nSubject: Re: <Political Atheists?\nOrganization: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena\nLines: 14\nNNTP-Posting-Host: punisher.caltech.edu\n\nkcochran@nyx.cs.du.edu (Keith \"Justified And Ancient\" Cochran) writes:\n\n>>No, that's just what you thought the theory meant.

The problem was not the resurrection\nwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population \n(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was\nthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the\nstate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism \nbecomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,\nand were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,\nand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since\nChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is\nseen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the\nissues with the resurrection.\n\nrandy\n\n[I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically\nbecause they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did\ncause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus.\nOf course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other\nthan a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians\nscholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --\nin effect, a delusion.  --clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger)\nSubject: Re: Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\nOrganization: Boston University Physics Department\nLines: 60\n\nIn article <11847@vice.ICO.TEK.COM> bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine) writes:\n\n>In article <115670@bu.edu> jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger) writes:\n\n>>In article <11826@vice.ICO.TEK.COM> bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine) writes:\n\n>>I am refuting nothing but simply telling you what I see, which is\n>>childish propaganda and nothing to be refuted.

Whilst I\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\n\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\n\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\n\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\nmay not.\n\n\"What is atheism?\"\n\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\natheism\".\n\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\nflat-out denials.\n\n\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n\nThe term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\nsure whether God exists.\n\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\nyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\n\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\nsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\nabout the universe.\n\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\nsee no evidence that God exists.\n\n\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\n\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\nmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\nprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\nthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\nprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\nby any present-day religion exists.\n\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\nGod are not really applicable.\n\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\ndetectable.\n\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\nimportance whether he exists or not.\n\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\n\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\nfrom all the other things that don't exist?\n\n\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\nthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\nworship.\n\n[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\n\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\n\n\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n\nFirstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\nactually believes in.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\n\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\"\n\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\nmany countries.\n\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\n\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\nchurch and state should remain separate.\n\n\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n surely that's the same as state atheism?\"\n\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\nnature.\n\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\n\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n pray?\"\n\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\nthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\n\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\nmotives.\n\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\n\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\nof religious beliefs.\n\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\nrather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n\n\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\n\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\n\nIt's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\nexpectations of others.\n\nOn the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\n\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\n\nThey don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.\n\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\nappearance.\n\n\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\"\n\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\natheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\n\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\nof self-preservation.\n\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\nwhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.\n\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\nactions.  For example:\n\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\n\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n   before salvation; 5% after.\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\n\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\nbehaviour.\n\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\n\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n\n\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\n\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\nwith what they observed around them.\n\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\nindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\nchoice that person can honestly make.\n\n\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\"\n\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\n\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\n\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\"\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\nfutile.\n\n\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\n\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\nthat has a \"meaning\".\n\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\n\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n\nIn the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just\nhard luck.\n\n\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\n\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\n\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n\nThousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments\n apply?\"\n\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\nbut to everyone else.\n\n\"What sort of harm?\"\n\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\n\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\nreligion.\n\n\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n sort of excuse.\"\n\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL\nChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?\n\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\naren't a perversion of what your God intended?\n\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\nChristian.\n\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\n\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\ndon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.\n\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n\n\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\"\n\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n\nOf course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\npurposes as well.\n\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n something?\"\n\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\n\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n that God exists?\"\n\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\n\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n nothing?\"\n\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\n\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\nother memes.\n\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\n\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\n\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.

In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure.

The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\n>\n>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.\n>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?\n>I don't know.\n\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\nno more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think\nit's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,\nbut God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\nweight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\nher improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\n\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\n(or something like that).\n\nMay we all experience and accept God's grace.\n>\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed\n>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not\n>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies\n>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n===============================================================================\nPaul Conditt\t\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\nApplied Research\tPhone:\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\n  Laboratories\t\tFedex:\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\nUniversity of Texas\tPostal:\t  P.O.

Of course,\nin your termonology, God could not \"cease to exist.\"  However, that is not what\ndeath ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see\nthat it signifies \"separation.\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is\nthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one\nmember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  \n\nI once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. \nShe was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my\n\"girlfriend\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were\nseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided\nthat she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was\ndeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is\nseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not\nbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go\nthere.  \n\n>> did you know that Jesus talked more\n>> about hell than He did about heaven!  \n\n>Thank you for this info.

I found no wisdom in\nthat until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He\nwas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued\non my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and\nunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us\ndo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. \nYou have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to\nyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  \n\n>Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel\n>     the pinpricks man dealt him...\n\nThis may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\n Jesus most certainly felt the \"pinpricks\" of life.  As the Scripture say:\n\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\nsin.\n\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \"The Consciousness of\nChrist.\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\ninteresting study, including clh.  \n\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\ndo.  He \"grew in knowledge.\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \"led of the Spirit\" to such\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \n\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\nnot.\n\n>Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I\n>     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and I'm going to\n>     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro-\n>     duction... :-)\n\nI was once a member of that club.  THe \"free thinker\" is a glorious ideal.  By\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \"rational\ndoubt\" when in fact he was led to it by his \"faith\".  He must acknowledge that\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a \"free thinker\" to criticize the\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\n\nPascal pointed out that \"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\"  The fact that skeptics are not\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-theist.\n\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\n\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\nis arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \"Look, your fly\nis undone!\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \n\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\nabsence.\n\n>  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is\n>    unworthy of my worship.  Better to burn in Hell than to\n>     serve a tyrant in Heaven..\n\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \"Highlander\" movie. \nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\nare to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\nunderstanding of Himself.\n\n--Rex\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: armstrng@cs.dal.ca (Stan Armstrong)\nSubject: Re: So far so good\nOrganization: Math, Stats & CS, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada\nLines: 22\n\nIn article <C4z5u3.Jxo@spss.com> luomat@alleg.edu writes:\n>\n>This may be a really dumb one, but I'll ask it anyways:\n>\tChristians know that they can never live up to the requirements of  \n>God, right?

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.

I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\nCentury.

There\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\nthat John would prefer.\n\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get 'em in and get 'em\nout\".\n\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\ncloser to your preferences.

I've\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\nsomething.\n\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\nliving together peacefully.\n\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\n\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\njudgement.\n\nI am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue\nbecause of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented\nnations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that\nChristians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the\nmid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite\nserious.\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: ata@hfsi.hfsi.com ( John Ata)\nSubject: Re: DID HE REALLY RISE???\nReply-To: <news@opl.com>\nOrganization: HFSI\nLines: 49\n\nIn article <Apr.12.03.44.39.1993.18842@athos.rutgers.edu> reedr@cgsvax.claremont.edu writes:\n>In article <Apr.10.05.31.46.1993.14368@athos.rutgers.edu>, luomat@alleg.edu (Timothy J.

However, the question \n\"why do I exist, in particular\" is _not_ an invalid question - this\nis not what I said.

What's up?\n| \n| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes\n| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.\n| Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a\n| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren't Jews, so we\n| aren't part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in\n| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to\n| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this\n| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but\n| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles\n| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,\n| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.\n\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\n\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\n\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\n\n4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ's, then are ye\nAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\nAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\n\n| \n| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,\n| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,\n| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected\n| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it's the\n| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.\n| \n| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments\n| into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to\n| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are\n| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to\n| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except\n| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take\n| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on\n| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to\n| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians\n| are free to choose the specific time we worship.\n\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\n| \n| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin\n| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer\n| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior\n| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still\n| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally\n| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not\n| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While\n| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go\n| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We're too good at\n| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral\n| guidance, from things like Jesus' teachings, Paul's advice, etc.\n| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same\n| function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in\n| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed\n| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that\n| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.\n| \nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\n\n| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of\n| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's\n| resurrection.  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early\n| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish\n| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but\n| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.\n| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also\n| implies gatherings on that day.\n| \n| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to\n| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day\n| Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a\n| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and\n| that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.\n\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\n| \n| It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time.  See\n| Rom 14:5.  Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about\n| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific\n| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that\n| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his\n| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the\n| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue\n| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col\n| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly\n| mentions Sabbath.)\n\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\nday of the moral law.\n| \n| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word\n| \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish\n| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the\n| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply\n| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering\n| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It\n| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated\n| for Jews, and the Lord's Day -- which is the free Christian worship.\n| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There\n| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians\n| support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside\n| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical\n| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish\n| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the\n| Lord's Day.\n| \nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\nmake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\n\nDarius\n\n[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\nthink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\n\nHowever I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\n\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \n\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \n\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\nworship was.\n\n--clh]\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: b711zbr@utarlg.uta.edu (JUNYAN WANG)\nSubject: Bible contradictions\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \nNntp-Posting-Host: utarlg.uta.edu\nOrganization: The University of Texas at Arlington\nLines: 2\n\nI would like a list of Bible contadictions from those of you who dispite\nbeing free from Christianity are well versed in the Bible.\n", "target": "alt.atheism"}, {"value": "From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\nSubject: Paul on weekly collections\nLines: 15\n\nMark Gregory Foster writes (concerning 1 Corinthians 16:2):\n\n > The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted\n > the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the\n > first day of the week was that this was when they received their\n > weekly wages.\n\nBut the ancient Romans did not observe a seven-day week.

This\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\n\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\nand isn't.  \n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\nis an attractive option.\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\n\nAlan Terlep\t\t\t\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\nOakland University, Rochester, MI\t\t\t\natterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\t\t\t\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\nRushing in where angels fear to tread.\t\t\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": "From: bohja@cnsvax.uwec.edu\nSubject: WITCHES AND WICCAN:  your opinion\nOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire\nLines: 19\n\nI am a student at UW-Eau Claire.

If the code was once perfect, and\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\nof this statement, shouldn't we?\n\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\n\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \n\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \n\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \nTry Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\n& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\n\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\n: theological perspective -- my own.

Would you please cite a few references that support\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\n\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\nmore important than we've thought - for instance, sex might\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \n \n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\n\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \n\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\n\nI'd replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\nevolve.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \n\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.

Do you have evidence against\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\nand not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. \n\nTheology does not use this method.

Bacteria and viruses\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it \nto the present. \n\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either\nclaim.\n \n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\n: answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\n\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does\nnot work, it fails miserably.\n \n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\n: \n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\n: that affect mankind?  I don't think so.\n\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\n\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\n: Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\n: universe.\n\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\n\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\n  \n: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)\n\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\n\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\n\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\nthese books.\n\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\n \n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\n: of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\n: environment.\n\nI'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\n\nTry reading P.W.

But in the Gulf War,\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \nWhat hogwash.

One\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\nconviction about everything they believed.

As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\nshow which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\n\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\n   fellowship\n   communion\n   filling with awe for God\n   all having everything in common.\n   glad and sincere hearts\n   praising God\n   enjoying the favor of the people\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\n7:54-60).  \n\n>- can one say that only one of these three churches is the\n>  true church of Jesus Christ?\n\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is\ntotally sold out to God.\n\n>\n>A problem closely related to these question is:\n>- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - \n>  before there is a unity?

As for those who think about only one church being the\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\nI know I haven't.\n\n>Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you.\n>For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which\n>are founded by people of one specific church and whose members\n>are all members of that church.

A clique is a group which\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\nwould've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\nwithin.  There's enough division without.\n\n>Thanks for your opinions in advance!\n>\n>Maarten\n\nJoe Fisher\n", "target": "soc.religion.christian"}, {"value": " cs.utexas.edu!uunet!olivea!sgigate!sgiblab!adagio.panasonic.com!nntp-server.caltech.edu!keith\nSubject: Re: <Political Atheists?\nFrom: keith@cco.caltech.edu (Keith Allan Schneider)\n <930401.112329.0u1.rusnews.w165w@mantis.co.uk> <11710@vice.ICO.TEK.COM>\nOrganization: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena\nNNTP-Posting-Host: lloyd.caltech.edu\nLines: 17\n\nbobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine) writes:\n\n>  And in the US, even that argument doesn't stand.

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\nthat they are infallible.\n\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\nprobably agree.\n\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\nis no way out of the loop.\"\n\n\nSomeone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\nleads to relativism.\n\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\nyou dislike them.  `REXLEX' wrote:\n\n>  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is\n> taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.\n\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\n\n *\n\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the\npoint at hand:\n\n>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be\n> experienced and it is verifiable.\n\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\n\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\nin very limited circumstances.\n\n\n>  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute\n> about a thing.\n\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nWe'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\n\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\n\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\nget into trouble.\n\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\ncannot be certain.\n\n\n\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\n\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nto cover them up.\n\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\n\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\n\n *\n\n`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\nelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\n Wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.

She was a cheerful\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\n    on\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\n    Eucharist.\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\trest  of  the\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\n    until\n\n\t\t\t\t   -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\n\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\tMaria\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\n    did the Holy Will of God.\n\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\ttwice\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\tlived\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\n\n\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\n    handkerchief,\"  as\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\ttouch\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\n\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\t\"No I\n    will  not,\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\n    of the baby Teresa\ton  the  landing  brought  the\tattention  to\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\n\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\taway.\n    As\tthe  ambulance\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\n    Communion\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\n    in\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\n    died at about three o'clock.\n\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\n    in\tMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.\n\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\tus  to\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\n\n\n    by Brendan Arthur\n\n-- \nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \nViva Cristo Rey !!

Andrew Byler)\nSubject: The Nicene Creed (was Re: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY)\nOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 152\n\nMichael Bushnell writes;\n\n>The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western\n>creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that\n>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but\n>it is not \"in use.\"\n\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\n\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\nCreed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\n\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\n\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it.\"\n\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\"\n\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will\nreceive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\n\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\nis the Spirit created.\"\n\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\n\n\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\nSon, His Sources.\"\n\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\n\n\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.

His explaination was that \nwhile it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence\nof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the \nChurch as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church \nrecoginizes itself as a community of believers, members\nof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable\nto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical\ncouple on the desert island, there are many places in the\nworld that do not have priests availible for marriages\non a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without\nthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify to\ntheir marriage when one comes through the area.  \n\n\tI remember a religion teacher in high school saying\nthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple\nas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,\nmarried couples have some responsibility to the community\nto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the\ncommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with\none another--the community should be able to rely on that \ncouple to be as one.\n\n\tWhile couples may marry without witnesses, they \nmay NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An \nanulment is simply an admission of the church that what\nthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage\nat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married\nin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves\nanulments a half-hour later!!\n\n\tI tend to agree with the response back there that\nsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate their\nmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider their\nmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they\nintended to be married, assuming they were both willing\npartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared\nto raise any children they may have as a result of that\nsexual act with the benefit of both parents.

I suspect\nthat's because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like \"even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement.\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and \"Holy Tradition\" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to\nsee why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing\nline.
